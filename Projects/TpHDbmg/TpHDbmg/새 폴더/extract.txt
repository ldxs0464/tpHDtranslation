What is it, ?
Transform into wolf<N>Talk to Midna
Transform into human<N>Talk to Midna
You don't have any magic power...<N>You know you can't turn into a<N>beast without it!
The yellow arrow marks where we<N>are. You knew that, right?
Whenever you destroy those<N>creatures from the darkness, a<N>portal opens that looks like this<N>on the map: .<N>You hear me? It's called a portal.<N>You'd better remember that!
And...in those woods we came<N>through...
Yes! It's got to be around there...

Tell me... Do you ever feel a<N>strange sadness as dusk falls?
They say it's the only time when<N>our world intersects with theirs...
...The only time we can feel the<N>lingering regrets of spirits who<N>have left our world.
That is why loneliness always<N>pervades the hour of twilight...
But enough talk of sadness...<N>I have a favor to ask of you,<N>.
I was supposed to deliver<N>something to the royal family of<N>Hyrule the day after tomorrow...
Yes, it was a task set to me by the<N>mayor, but...would you go in my<N>stead?
You have...never been to Hyrule,<N>right?
In the kingdom of Hyrule there is a<N>great castle, and around it is Castle<N>Town, a community far bigger than<N>our little village.<N>...And far bigger than Hyrule is the<N>rest of the world the gods created.<N><N><N>You should look upon it all with<N>your own eyes.
It is getting late... We should head<N>back to the village. I will talk to the<N>mayor about this matter.
Hey! ! You there?
Hey, you mind helpin' me herd the<N>goats?
Don't you think you should leave<N>town for a while? I mean, at least<N>until the uproar settles? THEN you<N>could come back...
With sword in hand, return to me...
Hey, what do you think you're<N>playing at? Leave that for later!




Demo 2:Meeting Ilia<N>(take 's horse to the spring)
Oh, done herdin' for the day,<N>?<N><N><N>Well, nice work.
The royal gift Rusl told you about is<N>ready, so you should get ready for<N>your trip to Hyrule Castle.<N><N>Now, the royal family requested<N>this gift specifically, so it's real<N>special.<N><N>It'd be...bad...if the representative<N>of Ordon were to be late for such<N>an occasion, you get me, lad?
The path before you is a long one,<N>my sweet horse...but please bear<N> safely along it.
Wait... What's this?
What's happened? She's injured,<N>isn't she?
! How could you!<N>You were pushing <N>too hard again! I bet you hurt her<N>leg jumping fences, didn't you!
Now, now, Ilia. There's no need to<N>get so hot with him...
FATHER!
How can you be so easy on him?<N>You're the MAYOR! You should<N>start acting like one!
You poor thing...
It'll be all right, .<N>I'll take you to the forest spring<N>right now.<N><N>Once we soothe you in the spirit's<N>spring, you'll feel better in no<N>time!
W-Wait! Ilia!!!<N><N><N><N>Why, without ...<N>The gift won't get delivered in time!
Oh, this won't do...
















Demo 4 (First half):Enemy appears at spring<N> in the darkness
I had no idea... I hadn't heard the<N>details about Talo's capture...<N><N><N>But, Colin...
So you still prefer your master over<N>me, huh, ?
Don't worry about your horse,<N>.
Fortunately, it looks like the injury<N>isn't too serious. You two can go<N>on together.
But, ...
Can you at least promise me this?
No matter what happens on your<N>journey, don't try to do anything...<N>out of your league. Please.
Just come home safely.


I... I knew you once...
Yes... This feels so familiar...<N>The scent of hay...
Long ago... When we were young,<N>you and I...
You were always there... You were<N>always beside me...<N>
.
This gift was meant for you. It was<N>something I wanted to give you<N>before you left on your journey.
Please, , take it.
You don't need to worry about me<N>any longer. Whenever you return...<N>I'll be waiting for you.
You got the porcelain horse call!

Wait...
Come...to my spring... 
You have...been transformed...<N>by the power...of shadow...
Come...to me...






Eee hee!
I found you!
Oooh! Aren't you scary!
Eee hee! Are you sure you want to<N>be doing that? Snarling and glaring<N>at me?
Well, that's too bad...
I was planning on helping you...<N>if you were nice.
Eee hee! That's much better!<N>You humans are obedient to a fault,<N>aren't you?
Oops! But you AREN'T a human<N>anymore, are you? You're a beast!<N>Eee hee!
There, there. You be a good boy<N>and calm down. No need to bite!
You look kind of surprised!<N>Eee hee hee!
So! I bet you're wondering, where<N>exactly are we?!
Well, I'll make you a deal. If you<N>can get over here, maybe I'll tell<N>you! Eee hee!
Hmph! I guess you're not<N>completely stupid after all!
Listen, I like you, so I think I'll get<N>you out of here.
But in exchange for my help, you<N>have to do EXACTLY as I say!
If you need anything from me, just<N>press  to give me a sign!
So, are we all clear? Good.<N>Now, come on! Get moving!







This way! Over here!
I'll be waiting for you, but you'll<N>have to help yourself for a change!




...Midna?!
Eee hee! You remembered my<N>name? What an honor for me...
So, this is the one for whom you<N>were searching...
He's not exactly what I had in<N>mind, but...I guess he'll do.
...You were imprisoned?

I am sorry.
Poor thing, he has no idea where<N>this is or what's happened...<N><N><N>So, don't you think you should<N>explain to him what you've managed<N>to do? You owe him that much...
...Twilight Princess! Eee hee!
Listen carefully...<N><N><N><N>This was once the land where the<N>power of the gods was said to<N>slumber. This was once the<N>kingdom of Hyrule.<N>But that blessed kingdom has been<N>transformed by the king that rules<N>the twilight...
It has been turned into a world of<N>shadows, ruled by creatures who<N>shun the light.
It is time for you to choose:<N>surrender or die.
Oh yes, a question for all the land<N>and people of Hyrule...
Life? Or death?!
The kingdom succumbed to twilight,<N>but I remain its princess...
I am Zelda.
You don't have to look so sad!
We actually find it to be quite<N>livable! I mean, is perpetual twilight<N>really all that bad?
Midna... This is no time for levity.<N>The shadow beasts have been<N>searching far and wide for you.<N><N>Why is this?

Why indeed? You tell me!<N>Eee hee hee!
Time has grown short. The guard<N>will soon make his rounds.
You must leave here, quickly.







Not that way! The guard's coming!<N>Boy, he's prompt!
Eee hee hee! Well? Do you<N>understand where we are now?
I guess a promise is a promise, so<N>I'll let you go back to where you<N>first tumbled into twilight...
But...are you really sure you should<N>be going back?
Are you sure you aren't forgetting<N>anything important?
Eee hee! Do you want to save<N>them?
Well, in that case, little Midna<N>would be happy to help you!
But...
Well, you'd have to be my servant...<N>and like a servant, you'd have to do<N>exactly as I say!
Why don't you go back, take a little<N>time, and give it some thought.<N>Eee hee hee!
Oh, that's right. I forgot to mention<N>one thing...<N><N><N>Though you may have left the<N>darkened realm, you haven't<N>transformed back to your former<N>self...and you won't anytime soon!<N>Now why could that be?
Eee hee hee!<N><N><N><N>See you later!








Beware... A shadow being...<N>It approaches...
O brave youth...
I am one of four light spirits that<N>protect Hyrule at the behest of the<N>gods. I am Ordona.
The black beast you slayed was a<N>shadow being. It had come to seize<N>the power of light I wield.
My brethren in Hyrule have already<N>had their light stolen by these<N>fell beasts.
The entire kingdom has been<N>reduced to a netherworld ruled<N>by the cursed powers of darkness.
The blight will not stop with Hyrule.<N>Before long, the entire world of<N>light will fall into the hands of the<N>king who rules the twilight.
To save this land from the king of<N>twilight, the lost light must be<N>recovered.<N><N>The three light spirits who have<N>lost their light must be revived.
There is but one who can revive<N>them and redeem this land...<N><N><N><N>You.
Those transformed by twilight<N>usually cannot recover their<N>original forms...
Unless... If you were to return to<N>Faron Woods where you were<N>first transformed... If you were to<N>revive the light spirit...
There, by the power of the light<N>spirit, you may find the means to<N>regain your other state of being...








Hmm! So these are the weapons<N>you use in your world?
You really think this thing can slay<N>the creatures of twilight?

That's not a bad bit of information<N>you heard, huh?
Ugh... Look at that open window.<N>This village is full of idiots.
So...
Ohhh... How did it come to this?
The children... Please say<N>nothing's happened...
Please forgive your good-for-<N>nothing father...
We should jump up there...but from<N>where?
Hey, there's someone over there,<N>too!
What could they be talking about?<N>I bet someone's worried about you!
But, ...<N>Can you at least promise me this?
To the hero...who was transformed<N>into a blue-eyed beast...in the<N>realm of shadows... In twilight...
...This way...
Just come home safely.
Hey! What's going on?
There should be one more... Where<N>could the last tear be?
What?!
There it is...
What's going on? This is weird...
Huh...
What are they doing there?
This is a pretty elaborate gate...<N>What are they trying to keep in?<N>...Or out?
I bet it'll be worth our while to dig<N>in...
...How about that?
Looks like you can climb the<N>scaffolding...
Hang on... You can use your sword<N>to make quick work of enemies<N>right in front of you, but distant<N>enemies are a different story.
Press the button you set<N>(, , or ) to equip your bow,<N>and aim with  or  before you release.
Why don't you try aiming for that<N>scarecrow?

Wanna go back to my mama?
Go back!<N>Not yet.
OK! I wanna stay here too!
You got it! Mama, here we come!
So... You know where we are yet?<N>Eee hee!
Well...if you go to the top, you<N>might figure it out!
Hey, you can climb up here!
H-Hurry...to where...Princess<N>Zelda...waits...
You found a play wooden sword!<N>It's Talo's...
Even though you change shape,<N>I still understand you.
... Hurry up and<N>return to your true self...

Better get going, don't you think?<N>Don't blame me for your world's<N>fate if you don't hurry up and find<N>that light!
Come on! Snap to it!




Welcome, Hero...
Please receive the blessings of the<N>fairies...
If you ever have need of me, come to<N>this place.
You have come to receive the blessings<N>of the fairies...but you haven't an<N>empty container...
If you ever have need of me, come to<N>this place.

Aww, but it was so nice here in the<N>twilight... What's so great about a<N>world of light, anyway?
Eee hee hee! See you later!
My name is Faron.
I am one of the spirits of light who<N>dwell in Hyrule. By the order of the<N>gods, I protect this forest.
O brave youth...
In the land covered in twilight,<N>where people roam as spirits, you<N>were transformed into a blue-eyed<N>beast...
That was a sign...
It was a sign that the powers of the<N>chosen one rest within you...and<N>that they are awakening.
Look at your awakened form...
The green tunic that is your garb<N>once belonged to the ancient hero<N>chosen by the gods...
His power is yours. His is the true<N>power that slept within you.
Your name is .
You are the hero chosen by the<N>gods.
Brave ...
A dark power rests in the temple<N>deep within these woods.
It is a forbidden power. Long, long<N>ago, I and the other spirits of light<N>locked it away.
Because of its nature, it is a power<N>that should never be touched by<N>any who dwell in the light.
But this world weeps beneath a<N>mantle of shadows, and so there<N>is no choice... You must match the<N>power of the king of shadows.
If you would seek this forbidden<N>power, then proceed to the temple<N>in the forest depths.





















Cripes! I don't see those black<N>brutes anywhere...
They've gotta be hidin' somewhere,<N>waitin' for their helpless little prey<N>to come out! Then they'll FEAST!
Shaman! I'm scared!
We are safe as long as we remain in<N>here, child. Be at ease.
Oh yeah? I wonder if the monsters<N>out there agree with you...
They sure didn't seem impressed<N>by my bombs! How long do you<N>think we can hold this sanctuary<N>against beasts that strong, huh?
Once they attack, it's OVER!
Remember the lady from the<N>general store? Just one of those<N>things attacked her, and a whole<N>gang from town went to save her!
And what happened? She was<N>already gone, and there were<N>TWO monsters waitin'!
...You connectin' the dots? That<N>means that if we get attacked by<N>them, then we'll be...
BARNES!
Beth? Are you OK?
Look, Renado... All I mean to say<N>is that it's risky here, too! Ain't<N>you got some place we can hide?
There is...a cellar.
WHAAT?! You've got a CELLAR?!<N>Where's the entrance, man?
The entrance to the cellar is<N>designed to open when all of the<N>candles have been lit...
Why didn't you say so sooner?<N>C'mon, now! Let's hide in there!
...I...would not do that.
When Father instructed me to<N>secure the cellar, I saw insects<N>like the beasts outside...
Don't cry, Beth! It'll be OK!
 is coming to save<N>us all!
...I can feel it!
The tears you hold... They are blessed...
Drink them and you shall better endure<N>the dangers that await you.
Your power is a gift given only to<N>those with confidence to wield it.

Huh? What is it?
So... Where could that pitiful<N>light-stripped spirit be?<N>
Don't you think heading to the<N>temple deep within Faron Woods<N>sounds like a good idea?

Aw, I was just starting to have fun!<N>Don't forget that Fused Shadow!
Eee hee hee! See you later!
My name is Eldin.<N><N><N><N>I am one of the light spirits of<N>Hyrule. I am the spirit that guards<N>these lands.<N><N>O great hero chosen by the gods...
The dark power you seek lies in<N>the sacred grounds of the proud<N>mountain dwellers.
But already those grounds have<N>been defiled, draped in shadow<N>and seeded with evil.
You must go to those sacred<N>grounds and cleanse them.
?!
Ha ha ha! See, Beth?! I TOLD you<N> would save us!
...You are the one from Ordon<N>whom these children spoke of?
We are well met. I am Renado,<N>shaman of this town.
And this...
This is my daughter, Luda.
The beasts took us and left us to<N>die...but Mr. Renado found us.
At first, I couldn't believe they had<N>come from so distant a place as the<N>Ordona Province...
Yeah, I... We don't remember much.<N>All of a sudden everyone was<N>captured, and then...until now...it's<N>been like...
...A nightmare.
Yeah! It was like a terrible dream<N>and we couldn't wake up...
Mmm... Nightmares are everywhere<N>these days, it seems. This village<N>has certainly seen its share of<N>recent hardships...
The dark beasts attacked, but even<N>worse was the sudden and<N>inexplicable change in the<N>mountain-dwelling Goron tribe.
They had long been our friends,<N>but suddenly treated us as foes.<N>Even now they refuse to permit us<N>entry into their mines.
It strains the limits of belief...<N>To think that such a gentle and<N>proud tribe could change so<N>suddenly...
It makes me wonder if something<N>in those mines is the cause of this<N>change...
In any case, you must take these<N>children and flee this village before<N>more nightmares descend.
I, of course, cannot leave my village<N>in such a time. There is no telling<N>what may happen to us here...
...But it is my job to try to coax the<N>Gorons back from their recent<N>change of heart.
I mean, the thing I'm looking for is<N>there, so maybe you'll find your<N>friends there as well!
Hey, remember that spirit... I bet<N>it has some good news for you!
Go talk to her and get the good<N>word!
What I'm looking for is supposed<N>to be in the temple deep in this<N>forest.











...
Is everyone...OK?
...Good.
Beth... I'm sorry. You know...for<N>shoving you. Are you mad?
I... I think I finally understand.
I understand what my dad meant<N>when he told me I needed to be<N>stronger, like you, ...
He wasn't talking about strength,<N>like lifting stuff. He was talking<N>about being brave...
... You saved me,<N>didn't you?
You... You can do anything.
You can do something to help the<N>Gorons in the mine too, can't you,<N>?
Heroic ...
North of here, across the plain and<N>past the great stone bridge, in the<N>lands guarded by the spirit<N>Lanayru...
You shall find one who you seek...
...
Ilia...
You've got to save Ilia!
Those monsters left me with the<N>other kids, but they must have<N>taken her somewhere else!
Whenever I thought I couldn't go<N>on, I would think of you and Ilia<N>and hold on, ...
See? I... I'm fine now.
Remember what I told you back in<N>Ordon, ?
When I grow up, I'm going to be<N>just like you, !
So you don't have to worry about<N>me anymore! Go help Ilia!
Leave the children to me. I will<N>watch over them, I swear it.
Do not let their fates trouble you.<N>Go to those who need you.
In Hyrule, countless tales are told<N>of the ancient hero...and your<N>deeds bring them all to mind.
May the graces of the great<N>goddesses who shaped Hyrule bear<N>you on your way.
I really, REALLY need to get it, so<N>keep your eyes peeled!
There are two more Fused<N>Shadows... Let's get a move on and<N>find them both!
Hurry! We need to head to the<N>Eldin Province to the east!


















Alter pitch Howl
Nothing happened...
If you want to cross Kakariko<N>Gorge, we need to find something<N>to span it...
We need to get back to Faron<N>Woods and look for something we<N>can use.
Enough already. Quiet down and<N>look for the light spirit Eldin...














You make sure to get that last<N>Fused Shadow, now!
Eee hee! See you later!
My name is Lanayru.
Your efforts have at last restored<N>each of us light spirits in Hyrule.
O hero chosen by the gods...
The dark power that you seek...
It waits in a temple set in the bed<N>of Lake Hylia.
...But before seeking it, you must<N>now bear witness to something...<N>and never forget it.
You must know that it was the will<N>of the goddesses that we lock away<N>the forbidden power...
When all was chaos, the goddesses<N>descended and gave order and life<N>to the world.
They granted power equally to all<N>who dwelt in the light, and then<N>returned to the heavens.
The lands where the goddesses<N>descended came to be known as<N>the Sacred Realm.
For ages, the people lived at ease,<N>content in mind and body...
But soon, word of the Sacred Realm<N>spread through Hyrule, and a great<N>battle ensued...
Among those living in the light,<N>interlopers who excelled at magic<N>appeared.
Wielding powerful sorcery, they<N>tried to establish dominion over<N>the Sacred Realm.
It was then that the goddesses<N>ordered us three light spirits to<N>intervene.
We sealed away the great magic<N>those individuals had mastered.
You know this magic...
It is the dark power you seek...<N>the Fused Shadow.
O hero chosen by the goddesses...<N>Beware...
Those who do not know the danger<N>of wielding power will, before long,<N>be ruled by it.
Never forget that...
You have a bark, right? Then you<N>should also have a bite! ATTACK!
If you don't help the spirit, we<N>won't have a chance of finding that<N>Fused Shadow.
Hey, don't think for a second that I<N>care about your world of light...<N>I don't! I'm helping you because I<N>have to! You remember that!
The dark power is in the sacred<N>land of the proud mountain people.<N>...At least, I THINK that's what the<N>spirit said.
The place you need to go...<N>You know where that is, right?
Hey... The light spirit is waiting<N>for you.

That is a Zora child! This is beyond<N>my expertise! Hmmmph!
Doctor, wait! If something isn't<N>done, this child will...
Well, this isn't good. A human<N>doctor won't do, huh...
That old coot reminded me,<N>though... I've heard of a shaman in<N>Kakariko Village, in the Eldin lands,<N>who's tended Gorons and Zoras.
Is that true? Perhaps if we take him<N>there...
Inadvisable! Too dangerous!<N><N><N><N>But we can't turn a blind eye to a<N>pretty girl in need, either.<N><N><N>Yes, we'd better escort you!<N>Am I right, boys?!
Well, isn't that nice.
To reach Kakariko, we've got to<N>cross two plains that are each<N>infested by dangerous beasts.<N><N>But we'll be safe now!

Cowards! Don't EVER show your<N>faces here again!
Oh my!
Looks like we've got one young<N>swordsman left!
And not only that, but it looks like<N>this brave young man will escort us,<N>so get ready to go, honey. Pronto!
You know that girl, don't you?
It's a real shame... She can't even<N>remember her own name right now.
Bless her heart...
She found this poor boy collapsed<N>in the road, so she did all she<N>could to save him.
More courage in that girl than in all<N>the soldiers of Hyrule, for sure!
You lend your strength to her,<N>you hear me?
So you say the bridge to the east<N>has been destroyed, huh? Then our<N>only option is to cross the bridge<N>to the west.
You see what that means?
You'll have to deal with that thing!
Th-Thank you so much for this.<N>Um, if you don't mind me asking,<N>what's your name?
...?!
I will never in all my life forget your<N>kindness, .
Little lady, I think you'd best save<N>your thanks until we're safe in<N>Kakariko...
This swordsman of ours has great<N>eyes, honey. They're proud and<N>wild...like a feral beast.
We need a beast right now, to keep<N>the true ones at bay. If we make it<N>to Kakariko safely, we'll just thank<N>him then, OK?
Hurry up and listen to what it has<N>to say!
Sounds like a Fused Shadow is<N>somewhere up that mountain...<N>so all we can do is climb!
I don't know what that Goron's<N>problem is, but you'd better come<N>up with a way to get up that<N>mountain...and quick!
...WHAT?! What are you talking to<N>me for? You have to help that kid!
Ugh... Look, hurry up so you can get<N>back to finding more Fused<N>Shadows for me!
That HAS to be the treasure that<N>the spirits entrusted to the<N>Gorons...
What in the world are you doing?!<N>Hurry up and find the Goron mines!
The person you're looking for is in<N>Lanayru Province, right? Well, good<N>for you.
Head to the twilight that has fallen<N>north of Kakariko Village.
The Fused Shadow should be there<N>too, so don't forget!
Ugh! Where can that last Fused<N>Shadow be?

...He has passed through the worst<N>of it. As long as he rests, he should<N>recover in due time.
Do you know the fate of his<N>mother?
Her welfare consumes him. He has<N>been mumbling deliriously about<N>her almost constantly...
...I can see the knowledge grieves<N>you. It must be an awful memory.
I'll stay with him until he's better!<N>No matter how long it takes!
Is that so? Thank you, Colin.
Hey, , about Ilia...
Is it true, what they said about<N>her?
Yes, she has lost her memory,<N>Colin, and regaining it will be no<N>simple task.
But it will be all right, child.

You learned the !
Forget the  and<N>learn a new smell?
Yes<N>No

But it won't fit in your wallet<N>now, so let's put it back.
But it won't fit in your wallet<N>now, so let's put it back.
But it won't fit in your wallet<N>now, so let's put it back.
But it won't fit in your wallet<N>now, so let's put it back.

































































Skills
If we just give her some time, I am<N>certain that Ilia will find her heart<N>again.
So, Colin, I'd like to ask you to<N>stay in this village until then.<N>It is our turn to show the courage<N>that you have already displayed.
Nice to see there's still hope here.<N>And it's always good to see happy<N>results repay your efforts...
Those skills of yours... Any chance<N>you're of the mind to put them to<N>use for Hyrule?
What hope there is in our kingdom<N>is frail and dying...but there's still<N>a group trying to do what it can.
And I'm a member of that group.
Call me Telma.
I may just stay here a bit longer.<N>I'm still worried about Ilia, and...<N>Well, never mind about the rest.
, I want to see you<N>again at my bar, you hear me?
The bar is actually a kind of safe<N>house for my friends. There's a<N>passageway that leads to the castle<N>from in there, as well.
If you ever need anything, stop by.<N>I'll be waiting for you, honey!
...... H-Hurry...
Hurry...to...Zelda...
The Master Sword is deep within<N>Faron Woods, in the Sacred Grove.
Get that sword and let's undo the<N>curse that Zant put on you!
I don't even know where the Mirror of<N>Twilight is...
But we might find a clue in the bustle<N>of Castle Town...
The mirror shards lie in deep mountain<N>snows, within an ancient wood, and<N>somewhere in the sky...
Hurry up and collect all the shards<N>so we can return the mirror to its<N>original state!

Wait... That should have revived the<N>spirit...
...Oh no!
Zant!
Did you honestly mean to take an<N>ancient and withered power like<N>this and turn it against me?
You are a foolish traitor, Midna.
Why do you defy your king?
I'll use my power to take you to<N>the location of the open portal...<N>Pick where you want to go.
When most people enter the<N>twilight, they can't come out this<N>easily. You'd better be grateful!
You can't warp from this province<N>until you find a new portal!<N>
You can't right now... That guy's<N>watching us...
What are you doing? Pick which<N>one you want!
No! This isn't the right place!<N>Get serious! Do it over!
Hey! Are you doing that on<N>purpose to make me mad?!
Are you trying to drive me crazy,<N>bringing me to a place like this?!<N>Give me a break!
Looks like the path's impassable...<N>but I can get you up it if you want<N>to go.
What do you want to do? I'll help<N>you if you want to go.
Hey... Look...
The Faron Woods that you know<N>so well... They're now covered in<N>twilight.
You might not be able to come<N>back here, but... Do you still want<N>to go?
Yes<N>No
It really doesn't matter to me<N>what you do...
The only thing that'll happen if you<N>just stand here is the steady<N>spread of twilight... Eee hee!
Want me to let you into the<N>twilight?
Yes<N>No
You changed your mind?
That won't work! Give it up!
Did you hear me? You can't return<N>to the world of light that easily!
......
If you want to go into twilight...<N>crawl under...the bridge...
...I should tell you... You can enter<N>the Twilight Realm...even without<N>my help...
I'm sorry...
If you transform here, it would<N>scare someone! You don't want to<N>do that, do you?
No! No! Someone will see you!<N>Transform where there's no one<N>around.
Huh? What is it?
Warp<N>Talk to Midna
Transform into wolf<N>Warp<N>Talk to Midna
My KING? You, who do nothing<N>but abuse the magic of your tribe?<N>You must be joking!
How dare you?! Are you implying<N>that my power is...our old magic?
Now THAT is a joke!
This power is granted to me by my<N>god! It is the magic of the King of<N>Twilight, and you WILL respect it!
My Midna... Did you forget? That<N>beast is one of the light dwellers<N>who oppressed our people.
No matter how much you may<N>desire otherwise, you will never be<N>more than a shadow in their world.<N>You cannot consort with their kind!<N>But if we can make their world<N>ours, Midna...light and darkness<N>will meet at last.
Our tribe will take back their<N>realm...and sweet darkness will blot<N>out this harsh light!
And that, Midna, is why...
I need you.
Not just for me, but for all of our<N>people... Lend me your power.
So be it... I will return you to the<N>light world you covet!
, hero chosen by the<N>goddesses...
Go to the princess locked away in<N>the castle.
That princess holds the key that<N>can unlock you from your shadow<N>form...
There are two mirror shards left!<N>There should be one hidden in an<N>ancient wood and another somewhere<N>in the sky.
Hurry up and collect the last two<N>shards so we can return the mirror<N>to its original state!
There's one more mirror shard to<N>find... Somehow, we have to get to<N>the sky...
Doesn't someone know the spell<N>that will restore power to the<N>Dominion Rod?
All right! Up to the sky to find that<N>last mirror shard!
You've collected all the shards of<N>the Mirror of Twilight...
Now, , let's hurry!<N>To the Mirror Chamber!
Zant is in the Twilight Realm!
I want to help Zelda and the people<N>of Hyrule... I truly do.

Midna!
Please... Please tell me... How do<N>we break...the curse on this one?
This...is the one... You need him...<N>to save your world!
That's why... Princess... Please...<N>You must help ...
What binds him is a different magic<N>than what transformed him when he<N>first passed the curtain of twilight.<N>It is an evil power.
Our world is one of balance...<N>Just as there is light to drive away<N>darkness, so, too, is there<N>benevolence to banish evil.
Head for the sacred grove that lies<N>deep within the lands guarded by the<N>spirit Faron.
There you will find the blade of<N>evil's bane that was crafted by<N>the wisdom of the ancient sages...<N>the Master Sword.
The Master Sword is a sacred blade<N>that evil can never touch.
Evil cloaks you like a dark veil...<N>and that blade is the only thing<N>that can cleave it.
... Hero sent by the<N>goddesses...
Like you, I have been granted<N>special powers by the goddesses...
Fine... ... You can...<N>You can get to the woods...on your<N>own, right?
Princess... I have one last<N>request...
Can you tell him...where to find the<N>Mirror of Twilight?
Midna... I believe I understand now<N>just who and what you are...
Despite your mortal injuries, you<N>act in our stead...
These dark times are the result of<N>our deeds, yet it is you who have<N>reaped the penalty.
Accept this now, Midna. I pass it to<N>you...
No! ! STOP HER!
We go back, ! Back to<N>Faron Woods!
Zelda... I've taken all that you had<N>to give...though I did not want it.
Please, ... Help me.<N>Help me defeat Zant!
We must save Princess Zelda,<N>! We must!
To Hyrule Castle!
Hurry, let's head to the Eldin<N>Province to the west!
There should be a spirit whose<N>light was stolen somewhere in<N>these lands, too...
You know what to do, right?<N>First we need to find the spirit or<N>we won't be able to return the<N>light to this land!
They said we can't get to the<N>spirit's spring... What's that<N>supposed to mean?

The sword accepted you as its<N>master...
This thing is the embodiment of the<N>evil magic that Zant cast on you.
It's definitely different from our<N>tribe's shadow magic...
Careful... If you touch it, you'll turn<N>back into a beast!
This thing is too dangerous...<N>It's probably for the best if we<N>just leave it here, huh?
But on the other hand...if we kept<N>it, you'd be able to transform into<N>a beast anytime you wanted...
Yes, since Zant was kind enough<N>to give this to us, we should be<N>thankful and use it all we can!
If you need it, just call me. I want<N>to keep a low profile, so I'll hide in<N>your shadow when you're human,<N>but I can change you whenever.<N>You can be a wolf anytime you like!<N>Also, thanks to this thing, you can<N>warp whenever you want by<N>switching into wolf form...

Hey, but listen, ...<N>I've got a little favor to ask...
Would you mind coming with me to<N>find something called the Mirror of<N>Twilight? It's hidden somewhere<N>in Hyrule...
Yes, the Mirror of Twilight...<N>Our last potential link to Zant!
Well, if there's a spirit in Lake<N>Hylia, then we need to go there.
All right... I wonder where the<N>spirit Eldin could be?

A cursed mirror that sends people<N>to another realm... That sounds like<N>the Mirror of Twilight.
, hurry.
If you put on that armor the Zora<N>queen gave you, you should be able<N>to dive even to the bottom of the<N>lake with ease.
I know it's been a lot of trouble,<N>but we've got the last Fused<N>Shadow almost in our grasp...
We're headed for the underwater<N>temple in Lake Hylia...so make sure<N>you're prepared!

Wait, .
Before we go on, there's something<N>I want you to hear.
...Do you remember what the spirit<N>said about the Fused Shadows?
What do you think happened to<N>the magic wielders who tried to<N>rule the Sacred Realm?
They were banished. They were<N>chased across the sacred lands of<N>Hyrule and driven into another<N>realm by the goddesses.
It was another world entirely...<N>The antithesis of Hyrule, where the<N>sun shines bright.
Its denizens became shadows that<N>could not mingle with the light.
Eventually, most came to call it the<N>Twilight Realm, and from it, none<N>could return to the world of light...
They were forever doomed to live in<N>the twilight, flitting in the half-light<N>of dusk, mere shadows of Hyrule...
This is the history of the Twili as it<N>has been passed down from our<N>ancestors...
Do you now understand what I am?
I'm a descendant of the tribe that<N>was banished to the Twilight Realm!
It was a peaceful place...until Zant<N>took control of the Twilight Realm<N>and transformed all of the Twili<N>into shadow beasts.
It's clear to me now that he<N>somehow gained a great evil power<N>previously unknown to our tribe...
In any case, I was sent from there,<N>and could no longer get into the<N>Twilight Realm without his power.
...But there's another tale told by<N>my people.
Though the goddesses forbade us<N>to return to the world of light, they<N>left one link between the light and<N>the darkness.
Something called the Mirror of<N>Twilight was passed to the<N>protectors of Hyrule...
It's our only path to the Twilight<N>Realm...and we must get there!
You'll come with me...won't you?
What's going on around here?!<N>I don't understand...
I think the spirit's spring should be<N>around here somewhere. Let's look<N>around some more...
Why don't you start by looking<N>around here?<N>

It sure does seem like something<N>strange is going on in this lake...
All you have to do is find the dark<N>insects and reclaim all the Tears of<N>Light, right?
Use the  map to find the locations<N>of the bugs. It's so simple!
That just leaves using your <N>senses and attacking! Hurry up and<N>start looking!
If you don't help the light spirits,<N>this world will forever be covered<N>in twilight as it is now.

Some call our realm a world of<N>shadows, but that makes it sound<N>unpleasant...
The twilight there holds a serene<N>beauty... You have seen it yourself<N>as the sun sets on this world.
Bathed in that light, all people were<N>pure and gentle...
But things changed once that foul<N>power pervaded the world...
It was all our doing...
We overestimated our abilities as<N>sages and attempted to put an end<N>to Ganondorf's evil magic...
I hope you can find it in yourself<N>to forgive our carelessness...
O Twilight Princess.
What? So...you knew?
As a ruler who fled her people, I'm<N>hardly qualified to forgive you.
In our world, we've long believed<N>that the Hero would appear as a<N>divine beast.
That's why when I found you,<N>I thought I could use you,<N>.
And I only cared about returning<N>our world to normal...
I didn't care what happened to the<N>world of light, not at all.
But after witnessing the selfless<N>lengths that Princess Zelda and you<N>have gone to... Your sacrifices...
I now know, in the bottom of my<N>heart, that I must save this world,<N>too. There is no other way.
If we can just defeat Zant, the<N>curse on me will dissolve, and we<N>may be able to revive Zelda.
Let's go, ! For Zelda!<N>For all of this world!


A dark entity lurks in the twilight...<N>It houses an evil power...
You who are guided by fate...<N>You who possess the crest of the<N>goddesses... Hear us.
At the command of the goddesses,<N>we sages have guarded the Mirror<N>of Twilight since ancient times.
You seek it...but the Mirror of<N>Twilight has been fragmented by<N>mighty magic.
That magic is a dark power that<N>only he possesses...
His name is...
Ganondorf.
He was the leader of a band of<N>thieves who invaded Hyrule in the<N>hopes of establishing dominion<N>over the Sacred Realm.
He was known as a demon thief, an<N>evil-magic wielder renowned for<N>his ruthlessness...
But he was blind...
In all of his fury and might, he was<N>blind to any danger, and thus was<N>he exposed, subdued, and brought<N>to justice.
Yet...
By some divine prank, he, too,<N>had been blessed with the chosen<N>power of the gods.
His abiding hatred and lust for<N>power turned to purest malice...
Perhaps that evil power has been<N>passed on to Zant...
You're just now figuring out where<N>Zant got his power? It's far too<N>late...
Only the true leader of the Twili<N>can utterly destroy the Mirror of<N>Twilight...so Zant could merely<N>break it into pieces.
Once broken by magic, the Mirror<N>of Twilight became fragments,<N>which even now lie hidden across<N>the land of Hyrule.
One is in the snowy mountain<N>heights...
One is in an ancient grove...
And one is in the heavens...
You who have been sent by the<N>goddesses... You should be able to<N>gather the three pieces...
But you must be prepared, for a<N>dangerous power resides in those<N>fragments...
You'd better fill the Vessel of Light<N>with all of the tears or there's no<N>telling what will happen... Eee hee!

So that must mean that we can't<N>get to the spirit's spring because<N>Lake Hylia's dried up, right?
Hmm... First, we'd better do<N>something about Lake Hylia...
Oh no... Do I have to hold your<N>hand through this?
Amazing... There isn't even a drop<N>of water in the river...

Zant.
Isn't this ironic? Here we are, all<N>thanks to the dark magic curse you<N>placed on !
You speak of magic? Still your<N>tongue for a moment, whelp, and I<N>will tell you of both magic and<N>the oppression of ages...
The people of our tribe...a tribe<N>that mastered the arts of magic...<N>were locked away in this world like<N>insects in a cage.
In the shadows we regressed,<N>so much so that we soon knew<N>neither anger nor hatred...nor even<N>the faintest bloom of desire.
And all of it was the fault of a<N>useless, do-nothing royal family<N>that had resigned itself to this<N>miserable half-existence!
I had served and endured in that<N>depraved household for far too<N>long, my impudent princess.
And why, you ask? Because I<N>believed I would be the next to rule<N>our people! THAT is why!
But would they acknowledge me as<N>their king? No! And as such, I was<N>denied the magic powers befitting<N>our ruler.
It was then, in the thrall of hatred<N>and despair, that I turned my eyes<N>to the heavens...and found a god.
I shall house my power in you...
If there is anything you desire,<N>then I shall desire it, too.
My god had only one wish...
To merge shadow and light...and<N>make darkness!
We should reach the water source if<N>we stay on this path, right? Right.<N>So let's hurry!
Who'd have thought that Zora's<N>Domain was covered in ice...
Oh no...  I can't believe what we've<N>gotten ourselves into.



Y-You...TRAITORS!
Traitors, ha! You want to know why<N>none would call you king? It was<N>your eyes, Zant.<N><N>All saw it, a lust for power burning<N>in your pupils... Did you think we'd<N>forget our ancestors lost their king<N>to such greed?
Midna... Foolish Twilight Princess...<N>The curse on you cannot be<N>broken...
It was placed on you by the magic<N>of my god! The power you held as<N>leader of the Twili will never return!
Already he has descended and<N>been reborn in this world...<N><N><N>As long as my master, Ganon,<N>survives, he will resurrect me<N>without cease!
I... I used just a fraction of the<N>power that's in me now...
I did THAT using only a fraction<N>of my ancestors' magic?!
! Now is the time!<N>We must save Zelda!
The evil power Zant was wielding...<N>I couldn't take it from him. But at<N>least I still have the magic of my<N>ancestors...
With it, I can return the cherished<N>power Zelda bestowed upon me...
Now! Let's go! Princess Zelda is<N>waiting!


This is not a time for idle chitchat!<N>Hurry up and get it done!
! Pay attention!
That's your town, right? Don't ask<N>me, you should know in your heart!
If you want to save the<N>townspeople, you must go back<N>into the twilight!
It's your town, isn't it?! Don't you<N>have some idea of where a sword<N>might be?!
Take advantage of the way you<N>look! Rather than ask me, why<N>don't you try asking the animals?!

Welcome to my castle.
So you're...Ganondorf.
I've been dying to meet you.
Your people have long amused me,<N>Midna. To defy the gods with such<N>petty magic, only to be cast aside...<N>How very pathetic.
Pathetic as they were, though, they<N>served me well. Their anguish was<N>my nourishment.
Their hatred bled across the void<N>and awakened me. I drew deep of<N>it and grew strong again.
Your people had some skill, to be<N>sure...but they lacked true power.
The kind of absolute power that<N>those chosen by the gods wield.
He who wields such power would<N>make a suitable king for this world,<N>don't you think?
Ha! Such conceit!
But if you are one of the chosen<N>wielders of power, as you claim...
I will risk everything to deny you!
I will risk everything to deny you!
Shadow has been moved by light,<N>it seems...
...How amusing.
Very well... Deny me, then!
Yes, try to deny me... You and your<N>little friend...
Both of you, faithless fools who<N>would dare to take up arms against<N>the king of light and shadow...
I don't know where the Mirror of<N>Twilight is, but it should be<N>somewhere in Hyrule.
I want you to help me find the<N>mirror, our only connection to<N>Zant...

You listening? Look for a sword<N>and shield that'll suit me. Got it?
Sounds like there should be a<N>shield at the house with the<N>waterwheel. Sneak in there and<N>take it, will you?
The location of the shield...<N>You know where it is, right?
Go back to the house with the<N>waterwheel and get it!
Sounds like the sword that was<N>supposed to be an offering to<N>Hyrule was left on top of the sofa...
The people around here are so<N>nice! I think we can just take it!
If you want to save the<N>townspeople, you should return to<N>the twilight!
The forest where you were<N>transformed into what you are<N>now... You know where it is, right?

Pr-Princess... I... I... 
Say nothing, Midna...
Your heart and mine were as one,<N>however briefly...
Such suffering you have endured...
Spirits of the light! Wielders of the<N>great power that shines far and<N>wide upon the lands of our world...
In my hour of need, grant me the<N>light to banish evil!
...
Chosen hero!
Lend us the last of your power!
All right...Now where's that<N>shield?
Hey, come on, why don't you<N>hurry up and grab that shield!
Ready? So... The thing that I'm<N>looking for is located in the temple<N>in Faron Woods.
Quit lollygagging around here and<N>hurry up and look for it!
All right, so next we have to look<N>for the sword!
Now that we've seen it, it's not like<N>we can ignore what's happening in<N>Zora's Domain.
Unless we can melt the ice, the<N>water will never be restored to<N>Lake Hylia.
We have to think of a way to melt<N>the ice...
We took the long route, but it's<N>almost time to meet the spirit...
All right, hurry! Let's go meet the<N>spirit of Lake Hylia!

When the chosen ones appear...
They are always born into this<N>world in perfect balance.
That is the destiny of the chosen.<N>That is the fate decreed by your<N>gods, the only path for those who<N>bear their crests. 
When this world brings forth<N>another marked as you are...
Know too, that it shall also be<N>visited by one of my blood.
Do not think this ends here...
The history of light and shadow will<N>be written in blood!
The Lanayru province is vast, so<N>finding dark bugs in it is a task in<N>itself...<N>
Use a portal or that bird that you<N>call near the reed whistles and get<N>it done!

What? Say something!
Am I so beautiful that you've no<N>words left?
Well...I guess this is farewell, huh?<N><N><N><N>Light and shadow can't mix, as we<N>all know.<N><N><N>But...<N><N><N><N>Never forget that there's another<N>world bound to this one.
Shadow and light are two sides of<N>the same coin...
One cannot exist without the other.
I know now the reason the<N>goddesses left the Mirror of<N>Twilight in this world...<N><N>They left it because it was their<N>design that we should meet.
Yes... That is what I believe.
Zelda... Your words are kind, and<N>your heart is true.
If all in Hyrule are like you...
Then maybe you'll do all right.
Thank you...<N><N><N><N>Well, the princess spoke truly:<N>as long as that mirror's around,<N>we could meet again...
...
I...
See you later...





I think it's just a matter of time<N>before light shines on the twilight<N>in Lanayru Province.
Hurry! Go get that last Tear of<N>Light!
All right... This is the real thing!<N>Hurry up and find the last Fused<N>Shadow!
I guess it's in the Lakebed Temple<N>of Lake Hylia but...can you swim?
To get your hands on the last<N>Fused Shadow, you have to dive to<N>the bottom of Lake Hylia.
Well then, why don't you save the<N>prince of the Zoras just as the<N>Zora queen asked?
The Zoras are usually the<N>protectors of Lakebed Temple, so<N>I think they should help us...
! The Mirror of<N>Twilight is so close... Let's hurry!
Who knew that a place like this<N>existed within Faron Woods...
Sounds like the wind... Do you<N>hear something, ?

Agitha had a dream last night.<N><N>Butterflies surrounded Agitha and<N>lifted her up to the sky.<N><N>As she waved to the people below<N>in Castle Town, she could see so<N>many people, some waving back,<N>others staring wide-eyed.<N><N><N><N>Agitha flew in a big circle above<N>Hyrule Field and the butterflies<N>formed into a bed beneath her<N>and said, "Let's play again..."<N>Soon they faded away and she<N>woke up in her own bed.<N><N>Ohh...

Dear ,<N><N>After we parted, I tried that word<N>on all the statues I could find in<N>Hyrule, but it was a disaster!<N>How disappointing!<N><N>...But if I let something so small<N>get to me, my dear father will<N>scoff at me from beyond the<N>mortal coil.<N><N>I'm going back to the sanctuary in<N>Kakariko Village to see if I can't<N>find another lead.<N><N>I certainly hope that if you find<N>any more information, you will<N>share it with me posthaste.<N><N>The dream chaser, Shad

You've collected 49 stamps. Well done!<N>Here is a special stamp as a reward!














It feels creepy...<N>, be careful.
So that big monster with the horns<N>built a base in a place like this?!
This place looks like it'll be<N>crawling with enemies, so be<N>careful, OK?
Looks like you're trapped...
Who knows what's around here, so<N>don't let your guard down...
Not this guy again!
Hmph! Let's teach him that flailing<N>a giant axe around is NEVER a<N>good idea!
If we want to get out of here, the<N>only thing we can do is break down<N>the gate!
Look! That boar looks strong<N>enough to do the job!
Hey, don't lose sight of that<N>monkey!
Now that you don't have your<N>lantern, you kind of have to follow<N>her, right?
Well, well... This place is hopping...<N>Eee hee!
Maybe if you light the candles,<N>you'll find the basement entrance...<N>Don't you think? This sanctuary is<N>old, but it sure is extravagant!
You haven't forgotten about the<N>spirit, have you? Hurry up and talk<N>to it!
Hurry up and get the gift from the<N>Zora queen!
Apparently that girl is holding the<N>key to the sky...
, we have to help her<N>get her memory back!
I'm happy we were able to help that<N>girl get her memory back.
And as a result, we were able to get<N>a tip on how to get to the sky!
, almost done!
It looks as though this is the<N>summit.
Hey... Hey! A giant white beast<N>holding a red fish...
At least your efforts yielded<N>something... Who would have<N>thought the yeti would have one of<N>the mirror shards?
All right! Let's hurry to the yeti's<N>house!
If we follow the scent, we may be<N>able to get through the snow!
We don't have any other option<N>right now... We'll just have to give<N>it a try!
Hurry! Let's get the mirror shard<N>from the house of the Snowpeak<N>yeti!

So...you're ...right?
Sorry about giving you so much<N>trouble before. I'm not proud of it,<N>but it's in my genes to obey anyone<N>who blows a reed. How sad...
I'll tell you what... Next time, call<N>me like that when you need<N>something. Who knows? I might be<N>able to help you out!
Hey there, .<N>I hope that you'll call on me again<N>someday. I'll help you out!
So...you're ...right?
Sorry about giving you so much<N>trouble before. I'm not proud of it,<N>but it's in my genes to obey anyone<N>who blows a reed. How sad...
To make up for it, I'd be happy to<N>take a look around and see if<N>there are any nearby items that<N>might interest you!
Let me make up for that mess<N>earlier by pointing out any<N>wonderful items around here!
, there's nothing<N>around here.
Hey! There's something near here,<N>!
Your voice... It sounded just like a<N>reed... That's why I flew down.

The first time up the mountain was<N>rough, but now the portal can take<N>us there in an instant!
The reekfish that the beast of<N>Snowpeak took...
Maybe if we took a look at it, it'd<N>give us a clue...
If the bridge being gone is the<N>handiwork of shadow creatures,<N>then they likely left it somewhere.
Was there any place that stuck in<N>your memory? Look for somewhere<N>that grabs you!
What's this? This village is really<N>muggy, huh?
The spirit Eldin is at the spring in<N>Kakariko Village. Don't lollygag<N>around! Hurry up and save it!
Hey, wasn't there a guy who knew a<N>lot about the people of the sky in<N>the bar in Castle Town?

Well, I guess you just have to ask<N>that guy to read it for you.
I get the feeling that little by little,<N>we're getting closer to the sky...
Let's do what we can for now,<N>.
I wonder what's hidden behind the<N>stone statue...<N>
A cannon...huh?<N>
I never expected to see something<N>weird like that...anywhere besides<N>that odd ride in Lake Hylia.
All right, , let's go!
We're close to the Mirror of<N>Twilight...
All right. The second Fused Shadow<N>must be somewhere here on Death<N>Mountain.
This is just one big pile of rocks.<N>I don't know where we'll find it,<N>so we'll just have to do a thorough<N>search!
That Goron elder is hiding<N>something...
Hey! Don't tell me you're afraid of<N>these Gorons all of a sudden! If<N>you can't sweet-talk 'em, you'll<N>have to power your way through!
Hey! The horse is running in circles...<N>Looks like it's startled by the bombs!
Look at your map and do something<N>before they drop another bomb!

They ain't listenin' to me lately!
Hey, where's ?
Hey! !











Oh, hi, .
I washed  for you!










Twilight covered Hyrule like a<N>shroud, and without light, the<N>people became as spirits.
Within the twilight, they live on,<N>unaware that they have passed into<N>spirit forms...
All the people know now is fear...<N>Fear of a nameless evil...










You still have not discovered your<N>true power...


























Northeast of here, in the lands<N>guarded by the spirit Lanayru...


The dark power that you seek is<N>within the sleeping Lakebed Temple<N>in Lake Hylia...





So you say the bridge to the west<N>has been destroyed, huh? Then our<N>only option is to cross the bridge<N>to the east.




































































So you choose. And so you shall<N>feel my wrath!

An impressive-looking blade...
But nothing more.
Would you hear my desire?
To take this foul blade...and use<N>it to blot out the light forever!













I'll try to slow Ganondorf with my<N>light arrows!
You target him and keep him within<N>range of my arrows!
